	"bio" : "Dean is shown to be more shy and effeminate like his father rather then his brother's outgoing and far braver personality, though this does fade somewhat later on. He is often far more cautious and fearful usually warning his brother against doing dangerous or foolhardy things which most of the time goes unheeded and earns him derision from his brother and leads to him being called a wuss. Dean even gets dizzy when he stands up too quickly and is often overpowered by his brother in horseplay.",
